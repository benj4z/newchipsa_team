# newchipsa

New website for chipsa, was made by me in 2017. 
It was first experience with frameworks after jQuery.
End there is nothing to proud of but i decided to stay this repo for the memory ;)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
